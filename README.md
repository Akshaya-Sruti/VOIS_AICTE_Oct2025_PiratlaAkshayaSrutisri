- **Duration:** 6 weeks (September - October 2025)  
- **Certification:** Joint certificate awarded by Vodafone Idea Foundation (VOIS) and AICTE  
- **Project Focus:**  
  - Building, evaluating, and deploying models for analyzing and summarizing conversational datasets  
  - Applying state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing techniques  
  - Gaining hands-on experience with real-world data and evaluation tasks

## Contents

- `Notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks with all project analyses and code
- `Datasets/` – Sample and/or processed data used during the internship
- `Reports/` – Project reports, summaries, and presentation slides
- `README.md` – Repository description and usage instructions
